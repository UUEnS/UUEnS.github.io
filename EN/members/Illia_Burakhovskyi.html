                <h4>Method for Treating the Human Musculoskeletal System</h4>
                <p>
        The utility model relates to the field of medicine, in particular to rehabilitative medicine, and can be used for the general improvement and treatment of the functional state of the human body, namely its musculoskeletal system. This model can be applied both at home and in treatment and prevention institutions: sanatoriums, health resorts, therapeutic physical training dispensaries, rehabilitation centers, and beauty salons.
        
        <h4>Claim of the Invention</h4>
        
        1. A method for treating the human musculoskeletal system, which includes restoring the hip joint, aligning the patient’s pelvis, spinal column, and cervical spine by means of shock vibration, acupressure, and therapeutic massage, characterized in that the asymmetry of the pelvic girdle is measured beforehand; the hip joint is restored with the patient lying on the side, by performing shock vibrations with a “hollow fist” on the greater trochanter in the direction of the center of the body’s lateral vertical axis, standing behind the patient; the pelvis is aligned with the patient lying on the stomach, one leg (on the side of the cranially displaced iliac bone) is bent at a 90° angle at the knee and hip joints, several downward thrusts are performed with the base of the palms, the procedure is repeated with the other leg, while thrusts with the base of the palms are performed in the iliosacral region toward the bent knee; the spinal column is aligned using acupressure combined with therapeutic massage in the area of muscular spasm (hump) or rib hump; the cervical spine is aligned by acupressure combined with cervical skeletal traction, with the patient lying on the back, the chin is fixed with one hand and the occiput with the other, and the cervical spine is gently stretched; after each treatment session, the asymmetry of the pelvic girdle is remeasured.
        <br><br>
        2. The method for treating the human musculoskeletal system according to claim 1, characterized in that, additionally, in the case of hemorrhoids or pain in the coccyx area, or inflammation of the genitourinary system, alignment of the coccygeal section of the spine is performed.
        <br><br>
        3. The method for treating the human musculoskeletal system according to claim 2, characterized in that alignment of the coccygeal section of the spine is performed with the patient lying on the stomach, legs shoulder-width apart, the sacrum is fixed with the base of the left palm, and with each deep breath of the patient, the middle finger of the right hand is gradually screwed in to the end of the coccyx, thereby pulling the curved coccyx into its anatomical position.
        <br><br>
        4. The method for treating the human musculoskeletal system according to claim 1, characterized in that skeletal traction is additionally performed during spinal alignment.
        <br><br>
        5. The method for treating the human musculoskeletal system according to claim 1, characterized in that during the restoration of the cervical spine, stabilization of the shoulder and scapular joints is additionally performed, wherein from the first to the fourth cervical vertebra fixation is made to the upper part of the scapula.
        <br><br>
        6. The method for treating the human musculoskeletal system according to claim 1, characterized in that lymphatic drainage massage is additionally performed after the completion of the therapeutic procedures.
