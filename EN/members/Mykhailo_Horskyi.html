                <h4>Module for Construction Columns and Prefabricated Construction Column</h4>
                <p>The group of inventions can be used in construction both as temporary demountable columns serving as supports for temporary or permanent roofs, and as permanent standalone columns, in particular as supports for power lines. The module is made in the form of a spatial figure with a closed lateral surface, two ends, and a through axial channel, as well as with connecting elements for joining the connected modules. What is new in the module is that each of the modules is made of concrete, its lateral surface is cylindrical or conical, or polygonal, and the connecting elements are in the form of first and second annular platforms symmetrical relative to the axis of the module and perpendicular to it, as well as in the form of an axial projection made on the first annular platform in the shape of a truncated cone tapering away from it, or a truncated pyramid, or a segment of a sphere, and a recess continuing the through axial channel and expanding away from it to the second annular platform, with the recess being shaped and sized the same as or 2–3 mm larger than the axial projection. The prefabricated construction column consists of several stacked modules described above. This ensures simplification of the design and manufacturing technology of the modules and reduction of their cost, and a simpler, more reliable, and less labor-intensive connection of the modules when assembling the column.</p>

                <h4>Wind Generator</h4>
                <p>The objective of the invention is to create a simple wind generator design without a mechanism for tracking the air flow, with protection against precipitation and with maximum focusing of the power of an artificial air stream onto the blade surface, which will increase the efficiency of the wind generator. The effect of the artificially created air stream should be additionally protected from the influence of other air flows. The design of the wind generator should reduce vibration oscillations. <br><br>Location also matters, for example near or above an overpass, to use the maximum power of the artificially created air stream to operate the wind wheel and the electric current generator, where the power of the artificial air stream depends on the density and speed of traffic during the day and throughout the year.<br><br>It is desirable to reduce the cost of manufacturing the wind generator and its payback period by making the components more universal, using simple technical solutions in the construction of the wind generator, which should also reduce maintenance costs. According to the invention, the objective is achieved by a wind generator that must have an air flow collecting and directing element and is made in the form of a concentrator with a canopy and an opening, inside which the wind wheel is placed, connected by an axle to the generator. The wind generator is placed on supports along the overpass, installed at an angle of less than 90° to the direction of traffic, with the opening facing the direction of the artificial air flow and a partially open side facing traffic. The canopy is designed to direct the artificial air flow onto the inner concave surface of the blade through the opening with 60 bent edges of the sidewalls, corresponding to the length of the blade. All blades of the wind wheel UA 99687 C2 2 are balanced by weight and have rounded edges. Each wind wheel has its own concentrator body with a canopy and opening, the width and length of which match the perimeter of the blade. The generator is located in the gap between the wind wheels on the supports, where a bearing for their axles is installed, reducing the effect of vibration loads on the structure of each support. The generator shaft is connected on both sides to the shaft of each wind wheel and is made from a thick-walled pipe. The blades have a concave shape on the inner surface that receives the air flow, and a curved shape on the outer surface to reduce air resistance and increase the rotation speed of the wind wheel.</p>

                <h4>Power Supply Device</h4>
                <p>The objective of the utility model is to increase the convenience of operating the power supply device while ensuring protection of the electricity consumer and maintenance personnel during battery charging from possible high-voltage breakdowns of device elements. The power supply device can be used in various electrical devices powered by a battery, for example, in portable equipment, in medicine, and in automotive power systems.</p>

                <h4>Shock Absorber</h4>
                <p>The invention relates to the field of instrument engineering, particularly to shock absorption systems located on highly dynamic moving objects with equipment sets, providing protection for the equipment from impact loads and vibration.<br><br>The shock absorber contains a hollow body, a spring, a rod, elastic elements placed on the rod, and a stop. The spring is a slotted spring with symmetrical slots, forming the upper part of the housing. Two elastic bushings are used as elastic elements. One bushing with a limiter is placed on the rod inside the housing and installed with gaps: a diametrical gap between the limiter and the housing, and a gap between the end of the limiter and one end of the stop, which is adjusted using spacers. The second elastic bushing is placed in a recess made on the side of the second end of the stop and installed with an adjustable gap between its end and a second limiter, which can be moved along the threaded rod. The invention provides a simpler and more compact design of the shock absorber, sensitive to loads in any direction, while reducing its weight.</p>

                <h4>Handle for Dental Instrument</h4>
                <p>The objective of the utility model is to improve the design of the handle for a dental instrument by introducing indentations of a given shape, which increases the grip of the doctor's fingers on the instrument during use, thereby reducing muscle strain in the doctor's fingers.<br><br>The handle consists of a body with a smooth outer lateral surface and a cavity for attaching the shank of a mount with a rigidly fixed mirror. At least two longitudinal grooves of a curvilinear profile with a smooth surface are made on the outer lateral surface of the body.</p>
