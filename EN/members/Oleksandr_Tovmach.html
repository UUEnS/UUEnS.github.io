                <h4>Proposals for Localizing Household Sewage Pollution</h4>
                <p>Proposals regarding toilets, dishwashing, and laundry: how these processes can avoid polluting the environment. Let's start with something simple.</p>
                <img src="https://cloud.enigma.ua/NVzvlvIgdOnFRsoAEvaWEhChH2bT9wFAzZ36x9JL.png">
                <p>The idea is to develop a small family business – a “laundry”. Concentrating washing agents in these mini-firms would allow full purification of wastewater, removing environmentally hazardous substances.</p>
                <p>The project is expected to be deliberately unprofitable, with the small family business subsidized by the state. This is a cornerstone of successful environmental protection. The rationale is simple, pragmatic, and rational. The cost of doing laundry at home includes: the cost of the washing machine divided by its service life (number of guaranteed washing cycles) + energy costs + water cost + wastewater disposal + cost of detergents + washing machine load factor (it's not always fully loaded) + drying function + ironing + energy for ironing + time spent on this household chore.</p>
                <p>With the laundry service: a worker picks up a soft container with laundry and later delivers it washed and ironed. The service cost = 1 hryvnia.</p>
                <p>There are certain concerns regarding underwear. Two options are proposed if a person prefers not to use the laundry service.</p>
                <p>Option A. A mini-washing machine that removes dirt using high-frequency vibrations, temperature, and other physical phenomena, achieving results without using chemical compounds, reagents, or reactants.</p>
                <p>Option B. Use disposable underwear for 24 hours, then dispose of it in a biomethane generator. Such underwear cannot be washed, as it should be made from compound-pressed yarn based on local hemp varieties and filled with cellulose. 100% natural materials.</p>
                <p>Why would this project become a priority for the state?</p>
                <p>1. Eliminates significant environmental pollution.</p>
                <p>2. Saves costs on water treatment.</p>
                <p>3. Improves ecological conditions.</p>
                <p>4. Saves energy and other resources.</p>
                <p>5. Allows the use of alternative energy sources.</p>
                <p>More on this: heating pressurized water using a solar installation.</p>
                <p>What is pressurized water? Here's an example:</p>
                <p>A kettle boils, and you can pour 6 cups of boiling water. The kettle is empty. Now imagine a sealed kettle under pressure, filled with boiling water. Instant depressurization turns all the liquid into steam. How to drink tea then? You pour a first level of cold water into each cup. Then, using a dispenser placed below the water level, add a measured amount of energy-saturated hot water. The molecules of this water have much higher energy potential than cold ones. Thermodynamic laws come into play. When energy equalizes between molecules, the resulting water in the cup will match the conditions of boiling water from the first case — but instead of just 6 cups, you get dozens more.</p>
                <p>This is what energy-saturated pressurized water is.</p>
                <p>Such technology is impossible to apply in every apartment with a private washing machine. But it is feasible for laundries serving hundreds of clients!</p>
